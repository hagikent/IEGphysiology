Analysis codes used for Hagihara, Karalis, and LÃ¼thi, 2025.

## Installation
A standard Matlab environment with the following toolboxes is required. 


-Signal processing

-Statistics and Machine Learning

-Image processing




We used a PC running Windows Server 2022 with:

Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8362 CPU @ 2.80GHz   2.79 GHz  (10 processors)

384GB RAM


## Data
Minimally curated dataset to run the code can be found in the [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/1ojd33lnh3b78owms7qmv/AFRUU4ZedmL2wbk_Atp7B6s?rlkey=tguimxpjesnqaz2g5cl51rn84&st=ntfoy437&dl=0).

The entire dataset to reproduce all the analyses in the study will be available upon publication in the FMI data repository server in an immutable manner.
